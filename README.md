## Energy Load Forecasting with Deep Learning
This repository employs deep learning models for load forecasting, including Deep Autoregressive model (DeepAR), Multi-horizon Quantile Recurrent Forecaster (MQ-RNN), Deep Temporal Convolutional Network (DeepTCN), and Dual-Stage Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN). The primary dataset used for experimentation is the Grenoble University building dataset.


## Key Features
**Deep learning Models**: The repository evaluates four deep learning models: DeepAR, MQ-RNN, DeepTCN, and DA-RNN. Each model is dissected, highlighting its architecture and strengths.
**Dataset**: Evaluates models on the Grenoble University building dataset, offering non-aggregated electricity consumption data for various room types over two years.

## Results
Performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and ùëÖ2 are used to evaluate the models for 24-hour and 1-week ahead predictions. Results showcase promising outcomes, with MQ-RNN leading in performance.
